# Technology Pack Public Board
Bugs and requests for the project 'Technology Pack' by Studio Plus.

This mod is about adding advanced tech and gadgets into the game.

There are 7 categories of technologies in this mod: Augmentations, Entities, Explosives, Firearms, Melees and Vehicles, as well as a miscellaneous items.

If you are suggesting something for one of the 7 technologies categories, remember they need to be future-esk (most important to remember for firearms, malees and vehicles)

Miscellaneous items usually probably will be cool or functional clothes or clothing items, like sunglasses (yes, this item will be addded in this mod)
